# Application State

As an application developer, you may already have a Redux store. You can simply inject the Jupyter UI store in your own store.

For now, we support [Redux](/docs/state/redux) to manage the application state.

We are considering other stores like `Mobx` or `Zustand`, please share thoughts and requirements on [this issue](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-ui/issues/50).
