# Setup

:::note

Many developers are reporting issues with their environment (build failures...). This is inherent to the mixed Python and JavaScript build as dependency on Jupyter toolchain. We are putting this issue at the <b>top of our priority</b> to ease your pain.

1. `Docker` and `devcontainer` with VS Code are the preferred option.
1. We have migrated to `Yarn v3` and latest `Lerna` to align with JupyterLab 4.
1. `engines` and `os` are enforced in package.json - We **only support** Yarn v3 on macOS and Linux.
1. We are offering `hosted kernels` so you don't need to run your local Jupyter Server. If you run `yarn start`, you will consume those hosted kernels from the cloud.
1. The default build should be faster and `not build the examples`, please give your opinion on https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-ui/issues/63.
1. We are looking towards `Pyodide` kernels (already supported for the Console component).

üëâ Please continue reporting any failure and idea on how to make a better experience. ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Environment

Choose the way you want to develop Jupyter UI:

1. [With VS Code Devcontainers](/docs/develop/setup/devcontainers)
1. [With Conda](/docs/develop/setup/conda)

Once you have applied the steps described in one of the above 2 options, you are ready to develop following the next steps.

## Install and Build

Install the dependencies. This will take some time, be patient. üëç

```bash
yarn install
```

Build the source code. This will also take some time, be also patient. üôÇ

```bash
yarn build
```

If you just want to develop the core package of the repository, the `@datalayer/jupyter-react`, just go to the sub folder and work there.

```bash
cd packages/react
yarn build
```

## Simple Example

Now you can start an example and hack the source code. The changes will build automatically and will be available in your browser.

```bash
# open http://localhost:3208
yarn start # start and example defined in the packages/react/webpack.config.js file.
```

This will consume kernels from the Datalayer development server in the cloud. You can run your own server with the following command.

```bash
# open http://localhost:3208
yarn start-local
```

The used Jupyter Server configuration is available [in this jupyter_server_config.py](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-ui/blob/main/dev/config/jupyter_server_config.py). The important part of that configuration is the `Security` part where the settings for CORS access are defined.

Additionally, you can to define in the head section your host index HTML page information for your React application about the location of your Juptyer Server (see for example the content of this [index-local.html](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-ui/blob/main/packages/react/public/index-local.html)).

```html
<script id="datalayer-config-data" type="application/json">
  {
    "jupyterServerHttpUrl": "https://oss.datalayer.tech/api/jupyter",
    "jupyterServerWsUrl": "wss://oss.datalayer.tech/api/jupyter",
    "jupyterToken": "60c1661cc408f978c309d04157af55c9588ff9557c9380e4fb50785750703da6"
  }
  </script>
```

If you are using the [JupyterLabApp](/docs/components/jupyterlabapp) component, additional information will be needed (see [index-local.html](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-ui/blob/main/packages/react/public/index-local.html))

```html
  <script id="jupyter-config-data" type="application/json">
    {
      "baseUrl": "https://oss.datalayer.tech/api/jupyter",
      "wsUrl": "wss://oss.datalayer.tech/api/jupyter",
      "token": "60c1661cc408f978c309d04157af55c9588ff9557c9380e4fb50785750703da6",
      "appUrl": "/lab",
      "themesUrl": "/lab/api/themes",
      "disableRTC": false,
      "terminalsAvailable": "false",
      "mathjaxUrl": "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.5/MathJax.js",
      "mathjaxConfig": "TeX-AMS_CHTML-full,Safe"
    }
  </script>
```

## Other Examples

We have more examples, pick one of the following commands and enjoy.

```bash
# Create React App example
# open http://localhost:3000
yarn jupyter:ui:cra
#
# Lexical example
# open http://localhost:3208
yarn jupyter:ui:lexical
#
# Docusaurus example
# open http://localhost:3000/docs/intro
yarn jupyter:ui:docusaurus
#
# Next.js example
# open http://localhost:3000
yarn jupyter:ui:nextjs
```

We also have some uncomplete or deprecated examples...

```bash
# Slate example (deprecated)
# open http://localhost:3266
yarn jupyter:ui:slate
#
# Prosemirror example (deprecated)
# open http://localhost:4567
yarn jupyter:ui:prosemirror
```

## JupyterLab Extension

Jupyter UI can also be shipped as a JupyterLab extension.

```bash
cd packages/react
pip install -e .[test]
# Double check...
pip list | grep react
# jupyter_react ...
```

Link the JupyterLab extension for development.

```bash
jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite
# Installing: .../jupyter_react/labextension -> @datalayer/jupyter-manager
# Removing: .../labextensions/@datalayer/jupyter-manager
# Symlinking: .../labextensions/@datalayer/jupyter-manager -> .../jupyter_react/labextension
```

```bash
jupyter labextension list
jupyter server extension list
```

```bash
yarn jupyterlab
```
